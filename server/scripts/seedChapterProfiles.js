/**
 * Publishes full chapter profiles — about copy, contact block and the complete
 * executive roster with portraits — for the chapters whose material the
 * secretariat has supplied.
 *
 * Portraits are read from <portraitsDir>/<chapterKey>/<chapterKey>-<slug>.jpg
 * (prepared from the chapter's own group poster / photo pack), uploaded through
 * the shared storage helper, and attached to Exco records scoped to the chapter.
 *
 * Idempotent: chapters are matched by name, exco by (scope, chapter, title).
 * Existing phone/email on a record are preserved unless this file supplies them.
 *
 * Usage (from the server folder):
 *   node scripts/seedChapterProfiles.js <portraitsDir> [chapterKey ...] [--no-photos]
 *
 * Naming a chapter limits the run to it. Worth doing: without a filter every
 * chapter re-uploads its whole roster, which is a fresh Cloudinary asset per
 * portrait for no change.
 *
 * --no-photos updates the roster text only and leaves every portrait where it
 * is. That is the common follow-up: the chapter corrects a spelling or confirms
 * a title weeks after its photos went up, and re-uploading them to fix a name
 * would be pure waste. <portraitsDir> is then only checked for existence.

/* Roster entries: [portraitSlug, name, title, order]

   Names and titles follow each chapter's own published material, verbatim —
   including whether a person is styled QS, Mr or Miss. Never add "QS" to a name
   a chapter supplied bare without asking them first: on the institute's own site
   that reads as a claim about registration, and Ebonyi's pack shows the chapters
   do distinguish. Ask, then record who confirmed and when.

   The secretariat settled what a bare name means on 2026-08-04: the person is a
   probationer, not yet a registered member, and should be styled Mr or Ms — not
   left bare and never QS. That is why Delta's YQSF Coordinator is Ms Nneli Esther
   Ifeoma below, over the chapter's own blanket claim that all fourteen were QS.

   Which cuts both ways, so do not sweep it: Niger's roster arrived bare to the
   last man including the Chairman, and a chapter chairman is not a probationer.
   A pack with no prefixes anywhere is a chapter that omitted them, not ten
   unregistered officers. Confirm per person before restyling anyone — getting an
   honorific wrong in public is worse than leaving a name bare.

   `address` is optional. Better absent than invented — the chapter page simply
   drops the line. */

         Morris) against the committee list's Mabel Morris Amangala. The pack's

    /* Thirteen executives, the second largest roster on the site after Lagos.

       The chairman's name runs the other way round from the committee list, which
       has "QS Gyadi-Gyadi Sa'idu Musa" where the chapter writes "QS Sai'du Musa
       Gyadi-Gyadi" — a reordering *and* a different apostrophe placement in the
       forename. The chapter's own spelling is published, as with Bauchi and Kogi
       before it.

       Four captions carry the same misspelling of "Secretary" as SECRETERY and are
       corrected; "ASST." and "PROD. DEV." are expanded.

       Two titles are recorded as close to the source as they can be without
       inventing meaning. "E.C.O(TECH.)" and "E.C.O (Prof.)" are published as
       E.C.O. (Technical) and E.C.O. (Professional) — the abbreviation is not one
       any other chapter on the site uses and nothing in the pack expands it.
       "SECRETARY RESEARCH & PROD. DEV." is published as Secretary, Research &
       Product Development; "Prod." could as easily be Production, and elsewhere on
       the site the comparable office is Professional Development. ALL THREE NEED
       THE CHAPTER TO CONFIRM.

       The three co-opted seats are distinct in the source — plain, young-member and
       WAQSN — so they do not collide on the (scope, chapter, title) key the way
       Lagos's did. */
