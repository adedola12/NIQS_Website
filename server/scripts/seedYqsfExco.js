/**
 * Publishes the Young Quantity Surveyors Forum's national Executive Council
 * (Exco scope:'yqsf') from the forum's own EC pack, July 2026.
 *
 * The YQSF page had only its Chairman on it, borrowed from his NEC card,
 * because he was the only member the secretariat's go-live package covered.
 * This seeds the other twelve so the forum gets the same treatment as every
 * other body on the site.
 *
 * Portraits are read from <portraitsDir>/yqsf/yqsf-<slug>.jpg, uploaded through
 * the shared storage helper and attached to the record. Idempotent: members are
 * matched by (scope, title), and any yqsf-scope record whose title is no longer
 * on the roster is retired.
 *
 * Usage (from the server folder):
 *   node scripts/seedYqsfExco.js <portraitsDir> [--no-photos]

/* [slug, name, title, order]

   The pack labels its files by name and office and nothing else, so the names
   here are bare — no QS, no post-nominals — because that is how they arrived
   and adding either on someone's behalf is a claim about registration that is
   not ours to make. Two are styled, and only on evidence: the Chairman from his
   NEC card in the secretariat's go-live package, and the North West coordinator
   from Kaduna's own senate pack, where he is also a co-opted member.

   "NAQSS" is left as the pack wrote it. The forum should be asked to spell it
   out, the way WAQSN's full name was settled before it went on the site. */
