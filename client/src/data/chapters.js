/**
 * The 37 NIQS chapters — one per state, plus the FCT.
 *
 * This list lived inside Chapters.jsx until the sitemap generator needed it too.
 * The generator runs in Node before the build and cannot import a file
 * containing JSX, so the data moved here: plain ESM, no React, importable from
 * both sides.
 *
 * Slugs are *derived* from the state name rather than stored. That is the same
 * rule ChapterDetail resolves by, so the sitemap can never advertise a chapter
 * URL the site would answer with a 404.
 *
 * The API is still the source of truth at runtime — /chapters overlays this with
 * whatever the secretariat has published. This is the floor, not the ceiling: a
 * chapter with no profile yet still has a page, and still belongs in the sitemap.
