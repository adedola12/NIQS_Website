 * Terms of use for niqs.org.ng.
 *
 * Scoped to the website. It deliberately does not attempt to restate the
 * Institute's constitution, its membership rules or its disciplinary procedure —
 * those are governed by the NIQS Act and the Institute's own instruments, and a
 * web page that paraphrases them creates a second, conflicting version of the
 * rules. Where a question belongs to those instruments, this document says so
 * and points at the Secretariat.
 *
 * For the Secretariat / the Institute's solicitor to confirm: clause 8 assumes
 * no payment is taken on this website today, which is true — the payments page
 * lists fees and no gateway is connected. That clause must be revisited before
 * one is.

            The authoritative record of who is a member of the Institute, and of
            their grade and standing, is the membership register held by the
            National Secretariat and the membership portal. Information shown here
            is published for convenience and may lag behind it. Anyone relying on
            a person's professional standing — a client, an employer, a public
            authority — should confirm it with the Secretariat.

            The same applies to the firms directory and to examination results

            about the Institute and the profession. It is not professional,
            technical or legal advice, and it is not a substitute for engaging a
            quantity surveyor.

          <P>
            Several parts of this site invite you to submit something: an enquiry,
            an event registration, a flyer request with its images and details, or
            material for publication. When you do:
          </P>

            <LI>you confirm that what you send is accurate, and that you are entitled to send it — including any photograph or logo in which someone else holds rights;</LI>
            <LI>you grant the Institute permission to use it for the purpose you sent it for, and — where the material is for an event, a flyer or an announcement — to publish it in the Institute's communications about that event; and</LI>
            <LI>you accept that we may decline, edit or withdraw any submission, and that we are not obliged to publish anything.</LI>

        <Clause n={7} title="Events, CPD and registrations">
          <P>
            Registering for an event through this site is a request to attend it.
            Places, fees, joining details and CPD points are set by the organiser —
            the Institute, a chapter, or a national body — and events may be
            changed, rescheduled or cancelled.
          </P>

            CPD points are credited on attendance and are recorded against the

            reliably be corrected afterwards.

        <Clause n={8} title="Fees and payments">
          <P style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            The payments page lists the Institute's current fees. Payment is
            <strong> not taken on this website</strong>; it is made through the
            channels the Secretariat provides, and those transactions are governed
            by the terms of whichever bank or payment provider handles them, not
            by these terms. Fees are set by the Institute and may change. If
            online payment is introduced here in future, these terms will be
            updated before it is.

            This site links to other places: the membership portal, chapter and
            partner organisations, job vacancies, and the websites of firms and
            sister institutes.
          </P>
          <P style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            We do not control those sites and are not responsible for their
            content, their availability or their handling of your data. A link, a
            job listing, a firm's entry in the directory or a partner's presence
            on this site is not an endorsement, a recommendation or a warranty of
            anyone's competence, solvency or conduct. Satisfy yourself before
            acting.

            We aim to keep the site available but do not guarantee it. It may be
            unavailable for maintenance, or because of a failure at a supplier, and
            we may change or withdraw any part of it without notice.
          </P>

        <Clause n={11} title="Liability">
          <P>
            Nothing in these terms excludes liability for death or personal injury
            caused by negligence, for fraud, or for anything else that cannot
            lawfully be excluded.

            content.

        <Clause n={12} title="Professional conduct">
          <P style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            Complaints about the professional conduct of a member are not a
            website matter and are not dealt with through these terms. They are
            governed by the Institute's own rules and disciplinary procedure, and
            should be directed to the National Secretariat.
          </P>

        <Clause n={13} title="Changes">
          <P style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            We may amend these terms. The version on this page at the time you use
