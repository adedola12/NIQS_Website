 * Privacy notice for niqs.org.ng.
 *
 * Written against the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 and the NDPR 2019, and
 * against what this site *actually* does — every processor named below is one
 * the code really talks to, and every category of data is one a schema in
 * server/models really stores. A privacy notice describing a generic website is
 * worse than none: it is a published statement the Institute cannot stand
 * behind.
 *
 * Two things the Secretariat must confirm before this is treated as final:
 *   - the retention periods in clause 7, which are sensible defaults rather
 *     than a stated NIQS records policy; and
 *   - whether a dedicated Data Protection Officer address should replace the
 *     Secretariat one in clause 11. Nothing here invents an email that would
 *     bounce.

            The Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (“NIQS”, “the Institute”,

            established in 1969. For the purposes of the Nigeria Data Protection

            describe it. If your question is about your membership record rather

            place.

            have a lawful basis for each use. Ours are:
          </P>
          <List>
            <LI>
              <strong>Consent</strong> — for analytics cookies, and for any

              administration, event registration and anything you have asked us
              to provide.
            </LI>
            <LI>
              <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — for answering enquiries,
              keeping the website secure, and maintaining the Institute's records
              of its own activities. We have considered whether these interests
              are overridden by your rights, and we think they are not; if you
              disagree, clause 8 explains how to object.
            </LI>
            <LI>
              <strong>Legal obligation</strong> — where we are required to keep

            </LI>

        </Clause>

        <Clause n={5} title="Cookies and analytics">
          <P>
            A cookie is a small file a website stores on your device. This site
            uses them in two ways.
          </P>

          <SubHead>Strictly necessary storage</SubHead>
          <P>
            If you sign in, we store a sign-in token in your browser so that you
            stay signed in as you move between pages. It is removed when you sign
            out. This is required for the site to work and cannot be switched
            off; no consent is sought for it, and it is not used to track you.
          </P>

          <SubHead>Analytics — only with your agreement</SubHead>
          <P>
            We use <strong>Google Analytics 4</strong> to count visits and see
            which pages people find useful. It sets cookies and sends information
            about your visit to Google. <strong>Nothing is loaded and no request
            is made to Google unless you accept the cookie notice</strong> — if
            you decline, or simply ignore it, the analytics code is never
            downloaded at all.
          </P>
          <P>
            We have configured it so that advertising features and
            ad-personalisation are switched off, and we never send your name,
            email address or membership number to it. Pages inside the
            administrator area and the member area are excluded from measurement
            entirely.

            You can also clear or block cookies in your browser settings at any

        <Clause n={7} title="Where it is kept, and for how long">
          <SubHead>Transfers outside Nigeria</SubHead>
          <P>
            As the table above shows, some of the systems that hold this data are
            located outside Nigeria. Sections 41 to 43 of the Nigeria Data
            Protection Act 2023 permit such transfers where the destination
            offers an adequate level of protection or where appropriate
            safeguards are in place. We rely on the contractual data-protection
            terms each provider offers, and we choose providers that publish
            them.
          </P>

          <SubHead>Retention</SubHead>
          <P>
            We keep personal information only for as long as it serves the
            purpose it was collected for:
          </P>
          <List>
            <LI><strong>Contact enquiries</strong> — 24 months after the matter is closed.</LI>
            <LI><strong>Event registration and attendance</strong> — 6 years, because attendance underpins CPD records members may need to evidence later.</LI>
            <LI><strong>Flyer requests</strong> — 24 months, together with the artwork produced.</LI>
            <LI><strong>Membership records</strong> — for the duration of membership and afterwards as part of the Institute's permanent record of its members.</LI>
            <LI><strong>Web-server logs</strong> — a short rolling period set by our hosting providers.</LI>
          </List>
        </Clause>

        <Clause n={8} title="Your rights">
          <P>
            Under the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 you may ask us to:
          </P>
          <List>
            <LI>tell you what personal information we hold about you, and give you a copy;</LI>

            <LI>withdraw consent you have given, without affecting what was done before you withdrew it.</LI>
          </List>
          <P>
            Write to the address in clause 11. We will respond within{' '}
            <strong>30 days</strong>. We may ask you to confirm your identity
            first — not to delay you, but because handing someone else's record
            to the wrong person is the failure these rights exist to prevent.
          </P>
          <P style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            Some rights are qualified. We may not be able to delete a membership
            record we are required to keep, for example; if we cannot do what you
            ask, we will tell you why.
          </P>
        </Clause>

        <Clause n={9} title="How we protect it">
          <P>
            The site is served over an encrypted connection. Passwords are stored
            hashed, never in a readable form. Administrative screens require a
            sign-in and are restricted by role, so a chapter administrator cannot
            reach another chapter's records. Access to the database is limited to
            the people who need it to run the site.
          </P>
          <P style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            No system is perfect. If a breach occurs that is likely to result in
            harm, we will notify the Nigeria Data Protection Commission within 72
            hours and tell affected individuals as required by section 40 of the
            Act.
