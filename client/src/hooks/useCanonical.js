/**
 * Keeps <link rel="canonical"> and the document title correct as the router moves.
 *
 * Both matter for the same reason and neither exists in index.html: that file is
 * served verbatim for all 60-odd routes, so anything hard-coded into it would be
 * a claim about every page at once. A canonical written there would tell Google
 * that /membership and the 37 chapter pages are duplicates of the homepage — the
 * fastest way to have subpages dropped from the index — and a single <title>
 * means every page competes in search results under identical text.
 *
 * This runs in the browser, which is a real caveat worth being clear about:
 * Googlebot renders JavaScript and will see it, but link scrapers (WhatsApp,
 * LinkedIn, X) do not, so the Open Graph tags in index.html stay as they are.
 * Pre-rendering the public routes at build time is the fix for that; see
 * docs/SEO_AND_ANALYTICS.md.
